# teleChatBot
<p>Requirement: installing request package</p>
<p>It's powerful Telegram python script to sending message, photo, and other files automatically. It's simply used by using function:</p>
<p>bot_sendText('Your message')</p>
<p>bot_sendPhoto('Your Photo Path')</p>
<p>bot_sendDocument('Your Document Path')</p>
<p>It's hopefully to send some important messages during your computing progress and sending your output files automatically in your telegram group.</p>

<p>This .py file can be used by changing 'YOUR TOKEN' and 'YOUR CHAT ID' in the script.</p>

<p>YOUR TOKEN could be obtaned by creating your account bot in @BotFather -> send /newbot -> following the next instruction. </p>

<p>YOUR CHAT ID could be obtained by these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Add the Telegram BOT to your destination group.</p>
<p>2. Get the list of updates for your BOT:</p>
<a>https://api.telegram.org/bot(YourBOTToken)/getUpdates</a>
<p>in there, you copy chat id to the script</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
